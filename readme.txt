For your personal website, choose and add:

    a font family
    indentation
    borders
    backgrounds and colors to text headings and paragraphs
    grid organization to text and/or images

When complete, share your html and css code. Be sure your css file is “linked” to your html file. These files have been set up for you here, as well as a preview pane. As your website grows, the preview pane will not be as useful and it is likely you will want to open your preview as a web page so you can see how it truly looks.

Things to keep in mind:

    make your page aesthetically pleasing
    make your page easy to read and navigate
